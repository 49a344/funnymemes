        <p> When I first heard about this meme, I was flabbergasted at how insanely funny it was. <br>
            The amogus meme was LIFE CHANGING for me, it was an experience only rivaled by eating<br>
            ice cream for the first time. It was better than any holiday, any new iPhone release,<br>
            for I would rather have Steve Jobs dead than not have amogus. Amogus was an extremely <br>
            influential factor in my early childhood development, it was insanely funny and once I almost <br>
            started throwing up bile because of how much this joke amused me. In fact, many other <br>
            individuals have found amogus <strong>SO</strong> funny, many have gone clinically insane. <br>
            Amogus is a "meme" that demonstrates compassion for a community; the fanbase was large <br>
            and helped many people survive a virus. I fondly remember many pensioners L'ing their A O <br>
            at amogus; it is a critical component of our identity as human beings, it weaves the fabric <br>
            of our society together, and it promotes community and truth-seeking no matter what the <br>
            current situation is. For this, amogus is a "meme" that can be considered a core part of <br>
            human nature; therefore its documentation and reference material belongs in the Library of Congress.<br><br>
            The premise is simple, the setup is nearly non-existent, as any joke can be enhanced with a <br>
            simple rallying cry of "<span class="shaking-text"><strong>AMOGUS!!!!</strong></span>" <br>
