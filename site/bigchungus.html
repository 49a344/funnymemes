        <h1>Big Chungus</h1>
        <p> Big Chungus is a funny fat rabbit from the hit show Looney Toons. <br>
            The main premise of the joke of making Bugs Bunny fat can be seen as obscure or even offensive<br>
            at first, however once you look at it from a lore perspective, it all makes <br>
            sense. You see, seconds before Bugs Bunny inflated himself into a balloon-like creature, <br>
            a man was nailing down a lid for a pit he put Bugs in. The caricature of the man was a <br>
            stereotypical fat American, and perhaps a satirical poke at the bourgeoisie, as there have been <br>
            many "memes" about communist Bugs Bunny. Once the fat American mocks an innocent rabbit, <br>
            Bugs Bunny <strong>instantly</strong> lifts the lid effortlessly, not bending or tearing a <br>
            single nail. He then proceeds to crawl out of the hole, turn around, and <em>mock</em> the <br>
            capitalist! Big Chungus shows a crude display of mockery for the upper class: his first-hand <br>
            insight on the toils they cause him, and the greed and sheer hatred for rabbits all reinforce this <br>
            belief and idea, this critique of endless cruelty and forced labor, endless consumerism; Big Chungus <br>
            sits back and simply mocks it all, he does not care enough to cause significant harm yet is amused <br>
            by the idea; he mocks the supreme authority (those with power, such as a hammer), displays disrespect <br>
            for their societal roles, all while barely trying. By lifting the wooden manhole without any effort, <br>
            he further reinforces the idea that force simply <em>cannot</em> always win, and wits combined with
            cleverness <br>
            always outsmart and overcome.<br><br>
